## Release Notes

### v3.1.1
- Added `--backup-blockchain` `--backup-wallet` command-line flags to `bytecoind` and `walletd` resp. to hot-copy blockchain and wallet data (wallet file and wallet cache).
- Fixed behavior of the `walletd`'s methods such as `get_balance`, which until now returned zero balance for addresses not belonging to the opened wallet file.

### v3.1.0

- Updated `README` in the part of linking with `boost` libraries to prevent using inappropriate versions.
- __API change:__ Renamed field `added_bc_transactions` to `added_raw_transactions` in response of the `sync_mem_pool` method.
- __API change:__ Renamed fields `bc_header` to `raw_header`, `bc_transactions` to `raw_transactions` in response of the `sync_blocks` method.
- __API addition:__ Added the `get_raw_transaction` method to the `bytecoind` API to get a transaction by its hash.
- __API addition:__ Added the `prevent_conflict_with_transactions` field to the `create_transaction` `walletd`'s method to be used by resilient payout queues.
- Speeded up memory pool to handle large transaction load.
- Fixed rare bug in `bytecoind` when less than possible transactions were included in block for mining during large transaction load.
- Fixed rare bug in `bytecoind` when cumulative difficulty of the block was calculated incorrectly, leading to increased orphan block percentage. (`bytecoind` will now perform quickcheck on start once for all exisitng blockchain database, fixing all differences.)
- Fixed rare bug in `bytecoind` when it stopped accepting new P2P connections or stopped answering API calls under high transaction load.

### v3.0.4

- Made early fixes to downloader to prevent long lagging behind.

### v3.0.3

- Fixed consensus bug.

### v3.0.2

- __API change:__ In `create_transaction`, `spend_address` parameter of type `string` is changed to `spend_addresses` of type `[]string`. This change is likely to affect only Web wallets developers.
- __API change:__ In `sync_mem_pool`, `added_binary_transactions` of type `string` is changed to `added_bc_transactions` of type `bytecoin::TransactionPrefix`. This change breaks compatilibilty between new and old `walletd` and `bytecoind`, so make sure they are both the same version.

### v3.0.1

- Added `walletd` option `--export-keys` to export keys in legacy format (for example, to print on paper and put in a vault).
- Changed logic of how `walletd` truncates cache in old wallet files: On writable media, it now tries to do that right after opening.
- Fixed wallet state undo logic, which rarely lead to sync crashes/stucks in version 3.0.0.
- Added test wallets for import/export testing.

### v3.0.0

- Added HTTPS support between walletd and bytecoind.
- Added generating and checking send proofs.
- Added SQLite database support as an alternative to LMDB.
- Added several legacy bytecoind RPC API methods for miners.

### v3.0.0-beta-20180219

- Reworked creating transactions with 100,000+ unspent outputs to make it much faster.
- Fixed rare crashes of `bytecoind` while downloading blockchain.
- Fixed stuck dowloading from misbehaving nodes.
- Added early support of JSON-RPC API basic authentification that prevents CSRF attacks.
- Added (experimental) support of 32-bit platforms.


### v3.0.0-beta-20180206

- Project is moved to the new public GitHub repository.
- Added `walletd` option `--export-keys` to export keys in legacy format (for example, to print on paper and put in a vault).
- Changed logic of how `walletd` truncates cache in old wallet files: On writable media, it now tries to do that right after opening.
- Fixed wallet state undo logic, which rarely lead to sync crashes/stucks in version 3.0.0.
- Added test wallets for import/export testing.
